It is incredible how much people agree on what is going on is the physical reality we inhabit with all the sensory noise going on (because the brain is an incredible thing), and yet there is interesting work from people like Donald Hoffman suggesting that our perceptions are likely to be far from approximations of an objective reality.

It is only when I was in the right environment that my biases and beliefs were challenged, and I built a political world view from scratch. I think of my beliefs about the world as a critical life-changing work that is my duty as a citizen of this world.
My beliefs are liberating, feminist, scientific and evidence-based, but also derived from revolutionary love. They're personally healing as much as they are angry at the state of the world. They're deeply interlinked with my womanhood. ",,l

I read and learn about world events on a very cursory level which allows me to live in blissful ignorance much of the time. From politics to economics, crime rates and unemployment rates, interest rates to  the news of plummeting home sales, I find that how I think about my own beliefs of the world, is that my perspectives are based on very limited information, and my perception of realtor of the world as it is today is likely better than what it likely actually is. I think about my own beliefs as being a self preserving shield keeping me away from realities that will affect me even when I don’t want them to. I see my beliefs as ignorance equals bliss. Not healthy per se but it keeps me from being consumed with negativity ",,l
